# Realtime with WebSockets - Demo Code
__Presented By [Giancarlo Gomez](https://github.com/GiancarloGomez)__

This is the demo code used in my WebSockets presentation.

* __angular-to-coldfusion__<br />The Angular Example I gave at CFSUMMIT2018. View README in directory on how to run.
* __assets__<br />The CSS and JavaScript files that are shared by the live demo UIs
	* __css__
	* __js__
* __chat__<br />The Chat demo
* __html-to-coldfusion__<br />The HTML to ColdFusion WebSocket example.
* __live-demos__
	* __demo-01__<br />Minimal requirements
	* __demo-02__<br />AdvancedSocket Example
* __other-demo-files__
	* __socket.io__ ( [node.js required](https://nodejs.org/) )<br />
	This is the code for the [socket.io](http://socket.io/) server that will run on port 8080.
	Remember to do an ``npm install`` after downloading and then run ``node server.js`` to start.
	* __socket.io_site__<br />
	The example site using the socket.io server to connect, send and receive messages both from the client and the server.
	This should be mapped to its own site or ran as a separate server using CommandBox.
* __swift-to-coldfusion__<br />The native iOS app example shown in CFSUMMIT2018. Getting this running is a bit more cumbersome and requires working with the [Starscream](https://github.com/daltoniam/Starscream) libray for using WebSockets in Swift. The code here includes the Main Storyboard and the main View Controller for reference.

## Running Demos ( CommandBox, Socket.IO and )
You can easily run the demos using CommandBox. Simply clone this repo to your local machine
and execute the ``box start`` command at the ``root`` folder for the main app and in the ``other-demo-files\socket.io_site``
folder for the demo of using Socket.IO instead of ColdFusion's WebSockets.

__The default server.json is set to use ColdFusion 2021. If you use this one make sure
to install the websocket package using cfpm and/or thru the administrator. If you choose to
do it from the CLI simply type the following while in CommandBox and/or the Server's bin folder__

```bash
cfpm install websocket
```

> Lucee server is not supported for these examples. If using Lucee, I recommend looking at the socket.io example
or using an existing service for WebSocket communication.

If you want to run other version's other than 2021 you can do so by starting the server as follows:
```bash
# ColdFusion 2018
box server start serverConfigFile=server.2018.json 
# ColdFusion 2016
box server start serverConfigFile=server.2016.json 
# ColdFusion 11 ( make sure to point to supported JDK if system version not supported )
box server start serverConfigFile=server.11.json 
```

__Application.cfc Settings__
To run this code you must set 2 request variables in ``Application.cfc``, these variables are for the site ran from ``other-demo-files\socket.io_site``

```javascript
request.socketio_server = "http://127.0.0.1:51095/";
request.socketio_broadcast = "http://127.0.0.1:51095/broadcast/";
```

__Socket.IO__<br />
As stated above you will need to run ``node server.js`` command at the ``other-demo-files\socket.io`` folder.

__HTML To ColdFusion Demo__<br />
Once you have configured both of your servers, make sure to go into the ``html-to-coldfusion\script.js`` and set
the values to the WebSocket Port used by ColdFusion and the Path and Port to your server.

```javascript
var cfws = new cfwebsocket(
    // appName for the server we are interacting => live-demos\demo-01
    'websockets_demo1',
    // the name of the channel we are subscribing to
    'demo',
    // the file to run in case a ColdFusion request has not execute yet
    'http://localhost:50320/live-demos/demo-01/runme/',
    // the global function to execute to parse a message received
    parseMessage,
    // the global function to execute when we subscribe
    subscribed,
    // if we are using the proxy method
    false,
    // the Port used by ColdFusion for WebSockets ( if not included it uses defaults defined in cfwebsocket.js)
    8581,
    // the server we are connecting to
    'localhost',
    // if the connection should be secure
    false
);
```

__Angular To ColdFusion Demo__<br />
Same as above, simply open the `angular-to-coldfusion\src\app\app.component.ts` file and set the attributes based on your ColdFusion instance.
```javascript
this.cfwebsocket = new window['cfwebsocket'](
    // appName for the server we are interacting => live-demos\demo-01
    'websockets_demo1',
    // the name of the channel we are subscribing to
    'demo',
    // the file to run in case a ColdFusion request has not execute yet
    'http://localhost:50320/live-demos/demo-01/runme/',
    // the global function to execute to parse a message received
    // we pass entire object and allow defaults to pass back to correct function
    this,
    // the global function to execute when we subscribe
    // we pass entire object and allow defaults to pass back to correct function
    this,
    // if we are using the proxy method
    false,
    // the Port used by ColdFusion for WebSockets ( if not included it uses defaults defined in cfwebsocket.js)
    8581,
    // the server we are connecting to
    'localhost',
    // if the connection should be secure
    false
)
```
